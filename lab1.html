    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

    <p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language.
        It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the
        web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
        developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
        you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make
        it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content
        into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.
        For example, consider the following line of text:
    </p>
</body>
